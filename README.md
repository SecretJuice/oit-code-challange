I enjoyed this challenge!

My general structural approach was to break things down into many small functions. If I'm correct, there's no function or method that has more than 12 lines in it. The idea of this is to make it easier to see sequences, like "first this, then that" relationships. One draw back of this is just having lots of functions in the file, but in my opinion this is outweighed by it's simple, more english-like readability.
